Task:
design a software that simulates dice rolling. the software should allow users to roll dice with varying numbers of sides and display the outcomes accurately. the program should prompt the user to input the number of sides on the dice they want to roll. after receiving the input, the software should generate a random number between 1 and the maximum number of sides specified by the user. the program should then display the outcome of the dice roll to the user. ensure that the software handles invalid inputs gracefully, displaying an error message and prompting the user to enter a valid number of sides if an invalid input is detected. the software should continue to prompt the user for dice rolls until they choose to exit the program.
