# Dice Rolling Software User Manual

## Introduction
The Dice Rolling Software is a Python application that allows users to simulate rolling dice with varying numbers of sides. The program prompts the user to input the number of sides on the dice they want to roll, generates a random number between 1 and the maximum number of sides specified by the user, and displays the outcome of the dice roll.

## Installation
To use the Dice Rolling Software, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once Python is installed, you can follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the software files.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the Dice Rolling Software, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the software files.
3. Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. The software window will open, displaying a label asking you to enter the number of sides on the dice.
5. Enter a valid number of sides and click the "Roll Dice" button.
6. The software will generate a random number between 1 and the maximum number of sides specified by you.
7. The outcome of the dice roll will be displayed in the software window.
8. You can continue rolling dice by entering a new number of sides and clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
9. To exit the program, close the software window.

## Error Handling
The Dice Rolling Software handles invalid inputs gracefully. If you enter an invalid number of sides (e.g., a non-integer or a negative number), an error message will be displayed in the software window. You will be prompted to enter a valid number of sides before rolling the dice again.

## Example
Here is an example of how to use the Dice Rolling Software:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the software files.
3. Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. The software window will open.
5. Enter the number of sides on the dice (e.g., 6 for a standard six-sided die).
6. Click the "Roll Dice" button.
7. The software will generate a random number between 1 and 6 and display the outcome of the dice roll.
8. Enter a new number of sides (e.g., 20 for a twenty-sided die) and click the "Roll Dice" button.
9. The software will generate a random number between 1 and 20 and display the outcome of the dice roll.
10. Continue rolling dice as desired.
11. To exit the program, close the software window.

## Conclusion
The Dice Rolling Software provides a simple and intuitive way to simulate rolling dice with varying numbers of sides. It handles invalid inputs gracefully and allows you to roll dice until you choose to exit the program. Enjoy rolling the virtual dice!
