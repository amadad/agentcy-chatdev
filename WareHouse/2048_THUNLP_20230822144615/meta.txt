Task:
design a simple 2048 game with a 10x10 grid. the game should follow the standard rules of 2048, where the player combines tiles with the same number to create new tiles with double the value. the grid should initially contain two randomly placed tiles with a value of either 2 or 4. the player should be able to move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. when the player makes a move, the tiles should slide as far as possible in the chosen direction, merging if they have the same value. after each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 should appear in a random empty spot on the grid. the game should end when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves available. display the current state of the grid after each move and provide feedback to the player accordingly. ensure that the game runs smoothly and without any errors.
