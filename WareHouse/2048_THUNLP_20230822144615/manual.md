# 2048 Game User Manual

## Introduction
Welcome to the 2048 Game! This game is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game. The goal of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by combining tiles with the same number to create new tiles with double the value. The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves available.

## Installation
To play the 2048 Game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can follow these steps to install the game:

1. Download the game files from the provided source.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game files.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the Game
To start the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game files. Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

A new window will open, displaying the game board.

## Playing the Game
The game board consists of a 10x10 grid. Each tile on the grid has a value, which is initially set to either 2 or 4. The player can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

To make a move, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Press the up arrow key to move the tiles up, the down arrow key to move the tiles down, the left arrow key to move the tiles left, and the right arrow key to move the tiles right.

After each move, the tiles will slide as far as possible in the chosen direction, merging if they have the same value. A new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 will appear in a random empty spot on the grid.

The game will display the current state of the grid after each move. If the game is over (either the player reaches the 2048 tile or there are no more valid moves available), a "Game Over" message will be displayed.

## Ending the Game
The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves available. If the game is over, you can close the game window to exit the game.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while playing the game, please make sure you have installed the required dependencies correctly. If the problem persists, feel free to contact our support team for assistance.
