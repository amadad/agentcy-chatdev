Modality:
gui application

Ideas:
1)implement a theme-based gui: instead of a generic game board, we can design the gui to have different themes that the user can choose from. for example, we can have a futuristic theme with a sleek game board and ai player, or a fantasy theme with a magical game board and characters. this will add a visually appealing and immersive experience for the user.  2) introduce power-ups and special moves: to make the game more exciting, we can incorporate power-ups or special moves that the user can use during gameplay. these can be earned or purchased using in-game currency. for example, a power-up could allow the user to place two stones in a single turn, or a special move could let the user swap the positions of two stones on the board. this will add an element of strategy and surprise to the game.  3) include a story mode: instead of just playing individual games, we can create a story mode where the user progresses through different levels or challenges. each level can have unique objectives or rules, and the user can unlock new features or characters as they advance. this will provide a sense of progression and engagement for the user, making the game more immersive and enjoyable.
