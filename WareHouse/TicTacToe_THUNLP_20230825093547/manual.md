## Main Functions

The Tic-Tac-Toe game has the following main functions:

1. User-Friendly Interface: The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to play the game with ease. The interface displays a 3x3 grid where you can make your moves.

2. Two-Player Mode: The game supports two players taking turns. Player 1 is assigned the symbol 'X', and Player 2 is assigned the symbol 'O'.

3. Determining the Winner: The game automatically determines the winner based on the moves made by the players. If a player successfully forms a line of three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game. If all the cells on the board are filled and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a tie.
